# Daily Bicycle Trips Analysis – Washington D.C

## Description
This project analyzes daily bicycle trip data in Washington D.C to uncover mobility trends and usage patterns. It also investigates the impact of weather conditions and identifies high-activity zones using spatial and temporal analytics.

## Objectives
- Clean and integrate bicycle trip datasets.  
- Explore and visualize trip data to understand usage patterns.  
- Identify patterns and trends in bicycle mobility using data analysis techniques.  
- Analyze the impact of weather on bicycle usage.  
- Detect high-activity zones and peak times using spatial and temporal analysis.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- GeoPandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Project Tasks

### [Task 01: Data Cleaning & Integration](notebooks/task01_DataCleaning.ipynb)
- Load and merge multiple bicycle trip datasets.  
- Handle missing values and inconsistent data formats.  
- Standardize column names and data types.  

### [Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](notebooks/task02_EDA.ipynb)
- Visualize trip counts over time.  
- Analyze trip duration distributions.  
- Explore user types, start and end stations, and daily/monthly patterns.  
- Examine the impact of weekdays, weekends, and holidays on trips.  

### [Task 03: Pattern Mining](notebooks/task03_PatternMining.ipynb)
- Identify high-activity stations and popular routes.  
- Detect peak hours and temporal trends.  
- Investigate correlations with weather conditions.  
- Map spatial clusters of bicycle trips using GeoPandas.  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaimaaalmously054-beep/Daily-Bicycle-Trips-Analysis.git
